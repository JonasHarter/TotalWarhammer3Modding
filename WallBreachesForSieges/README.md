# Wall Breaches for Sieges

Automatically creates a 5 wall breaches when sieging a walled settlement.
The created breaches are always clustered together.
By default is deactivated for the ai, because, as an attacker, it just ignores the breaches.
Even as a defender, the ai will only react to you, once your units enter the settlement; it won't proactively defend the breaches.
Configurable via MCT.
