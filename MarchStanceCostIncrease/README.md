# March Stance Cost Increase
Increases the cost to activate march-stance to 100.
Also applies to the naval equivalent.
This should prevent armies from attacking your settlements and then just marching out of range.

While the gui shows 100%, it actually means 100 movement-points.
Most character have a default of 110 movement- points by default and as far as I can tell, any gains are also points and not a percentage.
